High-level bindings
-------------------
The quickest way to learn how to use the bindings is to browse the tests.

* first, import the high-level python bindings into your module:

  import nim_py/high_level

* all nimrod-accessible python objects are wrapped with a reference of
type PPyRef.

* import python modules with a statement such as:

  let py_math = py_import("math")

thus imported, the module is a regular python object.

* evaluate python expressions with eval(), see python/test/test_py_eval.nim

* the operations supported on python objects are:
- member access with the ~ macro (see below)
- subscripted access and assignment, e.g.: person["age"] = person["age"]+1
- basic arithmetic (+, -, *, /, %)
- conversion to string with `$`
- len, repr
- create python lists with py_list()
- create python dicts with py_dict()

* since PPyRef is a reference type, Nimrod doesn't allow the syntax p.x 
where p is a wrapped python objects. Therefore, the macro `~` was created to
permit a similar syntax. For example, if the object p has members x and y, you
can write: echo ~p.x/p.y to print the ratio p.x/p.y.

Low-level bindings

The low-level bindings are a copy of the bindings by Andreas Rumpf, with very small modifications.
See the python/C API documentation.
