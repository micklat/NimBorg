High-level bindings
-------------------

See the test for usage examples of the features below:

* first, import the high-level lua bindings into your module:

  import nim_lua/high_level

* all nimrod-accessible lua objects are wrapped with a reference of
type PLuaRef.

* create a lua state object with a call to newLuaState()

* evaluate lua expressions with eval: state.eval("4+2") returns PLuaRef 
that wraps the number 6.

* create table objects using state.lua_table()

* lua objects support these operations:
- subscripted access and assignment, e.g. person["age"] = person["age"]+1
- function invocation such as f(x, y, z), with implicit conversion of arguments
to lua values.
- conversion to int, float or string

Low-level bindings
-------------------
The low-level bindings are a copy of the bindings by Andreas Rumpf, with very 
small modifications. The reader is referred to lua's documentation, which the 
low-level bindings follow very closely.
